# SussyLinkCheckerBot
A simple bot that scans attachments and links that are sent to a discord server/channel. This bot use virustotal API for scanning links and attachments, although sometimes virustotal API returns a false positive result this can still be useful for mitigations on possible scams, phishing, etc.

## Why make this project?
This project is being made, since the past year increasing cases of scam, phishing, and malware uploading are being done in discord servers. So, for mitigating the possible damages from these, I came up with this project.
